Ore algebra
============

https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra/

Description
-----------

A Sage implementation of Ore algebras, Ore polynomials, and differentially
finite functions

Main features for the most common algebras include basic arithmetic and actions;
gcrd and lclm; D-finite closure properties; creative telescoping; natural
transformations between related algebras; guessing; desingularization; solvers
for polynomials, rational functions and (generalized) power series. Univariate
differential operators also support the numerical computation of analytic
solutions with rigorous error bounds and related features.

Requirements
------------

Sage 8.7 or later is recommended. Some features should work with older versions.

Installation
------------

To download and install the latest development version on a system where Sage
was built from source or installed from official packages, run

    sage -pip install [--user] git+https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra.git

Alternatively, run

    sage -pip install [--editable] [--user] .

to install from the root of a git checkout.

The optional `--editable` flags causes the "installed" version to point to your
git checkout, making it easier to edit the code.

The optional `--user` flag causes the package to be installed in your .sage
directory instead of the Sage installation tree.

If your copy of Sage comes from operating system packages (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu,
Gentoo, or Arch Linux packages), try replacing "sage -pip" by "pip" or "pip3"
above.

Notes:

* To use ore_algebra directly from a git checkout (without installation), run
  "sage -python setup.py build_ext --inplace" from the root of the checkout, and
  add the src/ directory to your Python sys.path.

* ore_algebra contains compiled (Cython) modules which are automatically built
  as part of the installation procedure. Only some specific features depend on
  these modules, though, and the core features should work even if they are
  unavailable.

* To build the Cython modules against a version of Sage distributed as an
  operating system package, you may need some development packages that are not
  automatically installed as dependencies of the main SageMath package. For
  example, Debian and Ubuntu users need to install the liblinbox-dev,
  libpari-dev and libsingular-dev packages (and possibly others) packages in
  addition to the sagemath package. The command "apt build-dep sagemath" can be
  used to install all necessary development packages (and more).

Documentation
-------------

The documentation generated from the doc strings is available online at

    http://www.algebra.uni-linz.ac.at/people/mkauers/ore_algebra

Testing
-------

To run the test suite, install the package and run the command

    sage -tp --long --force-lib src/

at the root of the git checkout.
