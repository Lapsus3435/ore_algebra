Ore algebra
============

https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra/

Description
-----------

A Sage implementation of Ore algebras, Ore polynomials, and differentially
finite functions

Main features for the most common algebras include basic arithmetic and actions;
gcrd and lclm; D-finite closure properties; creative telescoping; natural
transformations between related algebras; guessing; desingularization; solvers
for polynomials, rational functions and (generalized) power series. Univariate
differential operators also support the numerical computation of analytic
solutions with rigorous error bounds and related features.

Requirements
------------

Sage 8.7 or later is recommended. Some features should work with older versions.

Installation
------------

To download and install the latest development version on a system where Sage
was built from source or installed from official packages, run

    sage -pip install [--user] git+https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra/

Alternatively, run

    sage -pip install [--user] .

to install from the root of a git checkout.

The optional `--user` flag causes the package to be installed in your .sage
directory instead of the Sage installation tree.

If your copy of Sage comes from system packages of a Linux distribution, try
replacing "sage -pip" by "pip" or "pip2" above.

Notes:

* To use ore_algebra directly from a git checkout (without installation), run
  "sage -python setup.py build_ext --inplace from the root of the checkout", and
  add the src/ directory to your Python sys.path.

* ore_algebra contains compiled (cython) modules which are automatically built
  as part of the installation procedure. Only some specific features depend on
  these modules, though, and the core features should work even if they are
  unavailable.

Testing
-------

To run the test suite, install the package and run the command

    sage -tp --long --force-lib src/

at the root of the git checkout.
